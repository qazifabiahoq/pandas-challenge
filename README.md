PyCity Schools Analysis
Introduction:
This analysis focuses on evaluating the overall performance of schools in a city's district, utilizing Pandas DataFrames to analyze standardized test data. The goal is to provide insights that will aid the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

File Structure:
All files related to this project are organized as follows:

Main Folder: pandas-challenge
Subfolder: PyCitySchools
Subfolder: Resources (contains two Excel files: schools_complete and students_complete)
Jupyter Notebook: PyCitySchools.ipynb (main script for analysis)
Data Overview:
The provided dataset includes information on schools, students, and their standardized test results. The analysis covers various aspects, including district-wide and school-specific metrics, school performance based on size, spending, and type, as well as scores breakdown by grade.

District Summary:
The district comprises 15 schools with a total student population of 39,170 and a budget of $24,649,428. The average math and reading scores are 78.99 and 81.88, respectively. The % Passing Math is 74.98%, % Passing Reading is 85.81%, and % Overall Passing Rate is 65.17%.

School Size Impact:
Smaller schools exhibit higher average scores and passing rates, suggesting a positive correlation with increased student engagement and community.

School Spending Influence:
Analysis of spending per student reveals variations in academic performance, emphasizing the need for nuanced resource allocation strategies.

School Type Differentiation:
Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in both average scores and passing rates in math and reading.

Per School Summary:

Financial Diversity: School budgets vary, with Cabrera High School leading in % Overall Passing Rate (91.33%) and the highest budget per student at $582. Huang High School lags in academic performance despite a substantial budget, indicating potential areas for improvement.
Academic Performance Variation: Cabrera High School leads in average math and reading scores, while Griffin High School, with a lower budget per student ($625), demonstrates high academic performance.
Highest-Performing Schools: The top-performing schools by % Overall Passing Rate are Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School.
Conclusions:

Impact of School Size:
Smaller schools consistently demonstrate higher average math and reading scores, along with superior passing rates. This suggests that smaller, more intimate learning environments positively influence academic outcomes through increased student engagement and a sense of community.

Effect of School Type:
Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in both average scores and passing rates. This indicates that charter schools may employ effective strategies or teaching methods that contribute to their success. Leveraging insights from charter schools could enhance overall academic performance within district schools.
